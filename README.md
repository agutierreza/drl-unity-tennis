# DRL-Banana-Unity


## Project Details

This is the final project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree. In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents)

These are some details of this Unity environment:

## Getting Started

This repository presents a solution for training the agents. You will need to download the Unity environment from one of these links depending on your operating system:

- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

The code is written in Python. Make sure you have a  `python 3.6` environment with the following dependencies: `PyTorch` and `ml-agents`. To make it easier you can create a new conda environment and then clone the DRL Audacity nanodegree repository to install dependencies from there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

## Instructions

Run the notebook `Tennis.ipynb` to train the agents.
